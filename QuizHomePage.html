	<h2> Burnley 1-1 Manchester United: Three Things We Learned </h2>
    <p> 
	north west derby of real importance on Tuesday night, Burnley and Manchester United played out an incredibly entertaining 1-1 draw. The Red Devils had some bad luck early on but still managed to take the lead thanks to a nice strike from the returning Paul Pogba.

	<h2> Barcelona 4-2 Atletico Madrid: Three Things We Learned </h2>
    <p>

Sure, everyone plays like it’s a cup final when they go up against Manchester United, but that doesn’t mean we should downplay what they achieved as a team. They secured a third consecutive draw and although it’s clear to see they need to start turning them into wins, they have an anecdote that works – and a manager who understands how to survive in this division.
