  <h2 style="color:#dde3f3" >  Real Madrid Club (Galácticos)  </h2> 
  
  
  <p  style="color:#dde3f3" > Galácticos (Spanish for galactics, referring to superstars) are expensive, world-famous Real Madrid football players recruited during the "galácticos" policy pursued during Florentino Pérez's presidency at Real Madrid, where in his first tenure in the early 2000s he purchased at least one galáctico in the summer of every year. Galácticos is now often used in a more general sense for a select list of football superstars in any team.
	The term itself carries both positive and negative meanings. Initially, it was used to emphasise the greatness of signing superstar players and the construction of a world class team.<br><br>
	Later the term attracted a more negative connotation; galáctico becoming synonymous with prima donna and used to deride the transfer policy and side (or team) built under it, following media perception that the policy at Real had failed to deliver expected levels of success.
	The term has occasionally been used to describe other teams, both in football and in other sports, that have been perceived to follow a similar policy. For example, British rugby union commentator Martin Gillingham called French club Toulon "rugby's galácticos" in 2012 due to a wave of signings of international stars by owner Mourad Boudjellal.
	<br><br>The rivalry comes about as Madrid and Barcelona are the two largest cities in Spain, and they are sometimes identified with opposing political positions, with Real Madrid viewed as representing Spanish nationalism and Barcelona viewed as representing Catalan nationalism. The rivalry is regarded as one of the biggest in world sport. The two clubs are among the richest and most successful football clubs in the world; in 2014 Forbes ranked Barcelona and Real Madrid the world's two most valuable sports teams.
	<br><br>Both clubs have a global fanbase; they are the world's two most followed sports teams on social media.
	Real Madrid leads in head-to-head results in competitive matches with 100 wins to Barcelona's 97 with 52 draws; Barcelona leads in exhibition matches with 19 victories to Madrid's 4 with 10 draws and in total matches with 116 wins to Madrid's 104 with 62 draws as of the match played on 20 March 2022. Along with Athletic Bilbao.
