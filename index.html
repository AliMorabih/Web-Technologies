	<h2> La Liga  </h2>
    <p> 
	The Campeonato Nacional de Liga de Primera División,[a] commonly known simply as Primera División in Spain, and as La Liga[b] in English-speaking countries and officially as LaLiga Santander for sponsorship reasons,[2] stylized as LaLiga, is the men's top professional football division of the Spanish football league system.[3] Administered by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional,[c] it is contested by 20 teams, with the three lowest-placed teams at the end of each season being relegated to the Segunda División and replaced by the top two teams and a play-off winner in that division.	</p>

	to forget about Burnley is just how resilient they are under Sean Dyche. Sure, everyone plays like it’s a cup final when they go up against Manchester United, but that doesn’t mean we should downplay what they achieved as a team. They secured a third consecutive draw and although it’s clear to see they need to start turning them into wins, they have an anecdote that works – and a manager who understands how to survive in this division.
